# Python Practice: Dictionaries and Tuples

This repository contains beginner-level Python scripts that focus on understanding and working with **dictionaries** and **tuples** â€” two essential data structures in Python.

## What I Learned

- How to create and manipulate Python dictionaries
- Accessing, adding, and updating dictionary items
- Iterating through dictionaries using `.items()`
- Creating and unpacking tuples
- Understanding the difference between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) data types
- Combining dictionaries and tuples for real-world use cases (like storing prices and quantities)

## Files Included

### 1. `student_scores.py`
Prints out student names and their corresponding scores from a dictionary using a loop.

### 2. `fruit_prices.py`
Demonstrates how to:
- Add a new item to a dictionary
- Update the price of an existing item
- Print the updated dictionary

### 3. `country_capitals.py`
Prints each country and its capital from a dictionary using the `.items()` method.

### 4. `coordinates_tuple.py`
Creates a tuple containing coordinates and uses tuple unpacking to access and print the x and y values.

### 5. `list_vs_tuple.py`
Shows the difference between mutable (list) and immutable (tuple) data structures. Also demonstrates what happens when trying to change a tuple's value.

### 6. `fruit_stock_cost.py`
Uses a dictionary where values are tuples representing stock and unit price. Loops through to calculate and print total cost for each fruit.
